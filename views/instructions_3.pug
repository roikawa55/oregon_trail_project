    h2 Spending and Hunting 
    p.
      YOU CAN SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY BEFORE YOU START YOUR TRIP 
      - OR YOU CAN SAVE SOME OF YOUR CASH TO SPEND AT FORTS 
      ALONG THE WAY WHEN YOU RUN LOW. HOWEVER, ITEMS COST 
      MORE AT THE FORTS.
    p.
      YOU CAN ALSO GO HUNTING ALONG THE WAY TO GET MORE FOOD. 
      WHENEVER YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR TRUSTY RIFLE ALONG THE WAY, 
      YOU WILL SEE THE WORDS: 'TYPE BANG'. THE FASTER YOU TYPE 
      IN THE WORD 'BANG' AND HIT 'RETURN' KEY, THE BETTER LUCK 
      YOU'LL HAVE WITH YOUR GUN.
    p.
      GOOD LUCK!!!

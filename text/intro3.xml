<h1>Oregon Trail - Spending and Hunting</h1>
<p>YOU CAN SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY BEFORE YOU START YOUR TRIP - OR YOU CAN SAVE SOME OF YOUR CASH TO SPEND AT FORTS ALONG THE WAY WHEN YOU RUN LOW. HOWEVER, ITEMS COST MORE AT THE FORTS.</p>

<p>YOU CAN ALSO GO HUNTING ALONG THE WAY TO GET MORE FOOD. WHENEVER YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR TRUSTY RIFLE ALONG THE WAY, YOU WILL SEE THE WORDS: 'TYPE BANG'. THE FASTER YOU TYPE IN THE WORD 'BANG' AND HIT 'RETURN' KEY, THE BETTER LUCK YOU'LL HAVE WITH YOUR GUN.<p>

<p>WHEN ASKED TO ENTER MONEY AMOUNTS, DON'T USE A '$'.</p>

<p>GOOD LUCK!!!</p>

<p>YOU CAN SPENDALL YOUR MONEY BEFORE YOU<br>
START YOUR TRIP - OR YOU CAN SAVE SOME<br> 
OF YOUR CASH TO SPEND AT FORTS ALONG<br>
THE WAY WHEN YOU RUN LOW. HOWEVER, 
ITEMS COST MORE AT THE FORST. YOU CAN<br>
ALSO GO HUNTING ALONG THE WAY TO GET<br>
MORE FOOD.
WHENEVER YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR TRUSTY<br>
RIFLE ALONG THE WAY, YOU WILL SEE THE<BR>
WORDS: 'TYPE BANG'. THE FASTER YOU TYPE<br>
IN THE WORD 'BANG' AND HIT 'RETURN'<br>
KEY, THEBETTER LUCK YOU'LL HAVE WITH<br>
YOUR GUN.<p>
<p>WHEN ASKED TO ENTER MONEY AMOUNTS,<br>
DON'T USE A '$'.<p>
GOOD LUCK!!!

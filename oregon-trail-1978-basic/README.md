Modified to work with this https://github.com/LiquidFox1776/LF-BASIC BASIC Interpreter

## Run

* 1978: `python BASIC.py oregon-trail-1978.bas`

## Notes

[1978 version](https://github.com/clintmoyer/oregon-trail) that's in this repo was carefully OCR'd and updated by @clintmoyer, tweaked by @scivision for ANSI BASIC compliance, retweaked by LiquidFox1776 to be mostly compliant with ECMA-55 standard. It has been play tested several times and appears to work as intended. The shooting routing requires a special function called CLK.
